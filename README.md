> Learn to create applications in TON in 6 quests. Clone the github links from site, go through 5-6 steps and immediately try some practical thing on TON. And only then proceed to complex tech tutorials.

# Introduction
Hey there! This is the TON Speedrun for HACK-TON-BERFEST 2023!
I created this product as an educational experiment and I'm so glad you're here!
# Description

`TONspeedrun` is an educational experiment. 

For more than a year I have been writing TON tutorials for my [channel](https://t.me/ton_learn) and publishing them [here](https://github.com/romanovichim/TonFunClessons_Eng). What I noticed:

The problem of a typical tutorial on crypto is that only prepositions are clear to a beginner(cell from c4 using adnl to slice e.t.c), and that there are a lot of steps (and on the 28th step...) in the tutorials, each of which has a lot of theory.

So if we imagine the process of a developer rolling into the ecosystem as a funnel, it will turn out that many fly off at the moment of the first touch with the technical side of TON(Although it is worth noting here that the people working on onboarding developers in TON are doing an excellent job and over the past year everything has become much better.).

And I want it to be different, as it is done in games, the first quests are simple and exciting to feel the game, and then thousands of hours in this game are just around the corner.

I want to make a series of 6 quests working on this principle. A person clones a repository, takes 6-7 steps and is already feeling some working, practically applicable product, and then there are links to already deep and complex tutorials.

# Main Features and Quests
* To gain access to the last three quests you need to complete the first three
* Each quest gives a practical result
* Since I wrote a lot of tutorials, quests highlight 20 percent of the information, which gives 80 percent of the result in TON

## Quests
* Deploy NFT Quest - the first step in developing smart contracts
* Chatbot contract Quest - feature of  TON - asynchrony and messages - let's understand
* Vending Machine Jetton Quest - Let's talk about standards
* Lottery Quest - Random and Development Logic on TON
* TonConnect Quest - ui for your smart contracts in 5 minutes
* Marktetplace Analyzer Quest - Get queries over ADNL protocol
